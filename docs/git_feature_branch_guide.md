I'll walk you through creating a new branch for your push notification feature and testing it before merging. Here's a step-by-step guide using basic Git commands:

1. **First, check your current branch and status:**
```bash
git status
```
This will show you which branch you're currently on and any uncommitted changes.

2. **Create and switch to a new branch for your feature:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/push-notifications
```
This creates a new branch called "feature/push-notifications" and switches to it.

3. **Add and commit your changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add push notification feature implementation"
```
This stages all your changes and commits them to the new branch.

4. **Push the new branch to your remote repository:**
```bash
git push origin feature/push-notifications
```
This uploads your new branch to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

5. **Test your feature:**
Now you can test your push notification feature. Run your application and verify that:
- Push notifications are working correctly
- All new functionality behaves as expected
- No regressions were introduced

6. **If you need to make additional changes during testing:**
```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix issue found during testing"
git push origin feature/push-notifications
```

7. **Once testing is complete and everything works:**
```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from remote (in case there are updates)
git pull origin main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge feature/push-notifications

# Push the merged changes
git push origin main
```

8. **Clean up by deleting the feature branch (optional):**
```bash
# Delete locally
git branch -d feature/push-notifications

# Delete remotely
git push origin --delete feature/push-notifications
```

This workflow ensures your new feature is properly isolated during development and testing, following Git best practices. The feature branch approach allows you to work on your push notifications implementation without affecting the main branch until you're confident everything works correctly.
