- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **PWA**: Service Worker and Web App Manifest

#### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python
- **Database**: MongoDB with Motor (async driver)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing

2. **Fix Settings persistence** - Wire profile updates to backend API
3. **Fix EventDetail loading** - Add individual event fetching capability

### Medium Priority (Short-term - Next week)
1. **Standardize data fetching** - Convert remaining direct API calls to React Query
2. **Enhance context integration** - Add API calls to context actions for better state management
3. **Add comprehensive error boundaries** - Better error handling throughout the app

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
1. **WebSocket implementation** - Replace polling with real-time WebSocket updates
2. **Push notifications** - Mobile push notifications for important events
3. **Email notifications** - Email notifications for proposals and reminders
4. **Recurring events** - Support for recurring event patterns
5. **Calendar integrations** - Google Calendar, Outlook integration
6. **Advanced filtering** - Search and filter capabilities
7. **Data export/import** - Backup and restore functionality

## Development Setup

## Key Improvements Made

### Since Original Review
1. **Proposal System Completed** - Accept/decline buttons now fully functional
2. **Partner System Enhanced** - Complete invitation and acceptance workflow
3. **Real-time Updates Added** - Polling system keeps data synchronized
4. **Calendar Fully Implemented** - Complete calendar with all features
5. **Authentication Enhanced** - JWT refresh tokens and better security
6. **UI/UX Polished** - Mobile-first responsive design throughout

## Recommendations

1. **Complete the critical data loading fixes** - Calendar, Settings, EventDetail
2. **Standardize on React Query** - Convert remaining direct API calls for consistency
3. **Add comprehensive testing** - Unit tests for both frontend and backend
4. **Consider WebSocket upgrade** - For better real-time performance
5. **Implement push notifications** - For better user engagement
6. **Add advanced features gradually** - Recurring events, calendar integrations

## Conclusion

The project has evolved significantly since the original review. What was previously identified as "missing or incomplete" has largely been implemented. The core functionality for a couples' scheduling app is now complete and functional.

The current focus should be on fixing the remaining data loading and persistence issues, then moving toward advanced features and performance optimizations. The codebase demonstrates modern full-stack development practices and is well-positioned for future enhancements.

**Current Status**: The app is functionally complete for its core use case. The remaining issues are integration and polish items rather than missing core functionality.
